Transition State Tools for VASP
===============================

This is not the official VASP web page. Designed to simulate the properties of systems at the atomic scale, `VASP (Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package)`_ is a software package created, distributed, and maintained by the Hafner Research Group at the University of Vienna.

Vasp TST Tools
==============

This page contains source code and scripts for finding saddle points and evaluating transition state theory (TST) rate constants with VASP.

Three saddle point finding methods and a couple other tools have been implemented to work with the VASP code. These methods are the

- :ref:`Nudged Elastic Band <neb>`: method for finding reaction pathways between two stable states.
- :ref:`Dimer <dimer>`: method for finding reaction pathways when only one state is known.
- :ref:`Lanczos <lanczos>`: provides an alternative way to find the lowest mode and find saddle points.
- :ref:`Optimizers <optimizers>`: provides an alternative way to find the lowest mode and find saddle points.
- :ref:`Dynamical Matrix <dymmat>`: uses finite difference to find normal modes and reaction prefactors.
- :ref:`Bader <bader>`: analysis of charge density grids to find charges and dipole moments of atoms in molecules.

Note to Users
=============

The code on this site was written by several people who were in or associated with the `Jónsson group`_. Development and maintenance are now being coordinated in the `Henkelman group`_ at UT Austin.

We have a `discussion forum`_ to address issues related to the code and scripts.
